Guidelines for developers of the soi-toolkit...

= Release handling =

To release maven based components of soi-toolkit we use mavens release-plugin.

Perform the following steps

 # Check that the code is in synch
  * Check for updates:
{{{
svn update
}}}
  * Commit changes
{{{
svn commit
}}}
 # Check versions of dependencies and parent pom, replace any SNAPSHOT-versions with stable ones. 
 # Perform a dryrun to verify that everything is ok, i.e. a release build will be successful and not fail in the middle leaving the release build in an inconsistent state. *Note:* Version numbers shall follow the format defined below.
{{{
mvn release:clean release:prepare -DdryRun=true
}}}
 # Fix any problems identified by the dryrun then perform a prepare-step
{{{
mvn release:clean release:prepare
}}}
 # *TO BE DECIDED*: How will we perform the deploy, by the step above or in a separate step

= Naming Conventions =

Version numbers of components:
 * {{{n.n.n}}} for released components
 * {{{REL-n.n.n}}} for svn tags for released components
 * {{{n.n.n-SNAPSHOT}}} for unreleased components during development
