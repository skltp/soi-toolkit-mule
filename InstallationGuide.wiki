<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

= Introduction =

To get started with soi-toolkit and Mule ESB you only need to install Java SE, Eclipse, Maven and the soi-toolkit Eclipse plugin. See section [#Required_installations Required installations] for instructions.

Depending on your needs you also might want to install some optional tools in your development environment such as Subversion clients, test tool for Web Services, soapUI, or setting up PKI - keys for usage with the SFTP transport. See section [#Optional_installations Optional installations] for instructions on how to install and configure these optional tools.

The installation guides below assumes your on a 32 bit Microsoft Windows PC.

==Required installations==

The following versions (or newer) are recommended:
|| *Tool* || *Version* ||
||Java SE||6 Update 21||
||Eclipse EE||3.6.1 (Helios)||
||Maven||2.2.1||
||Maven plugin for Eclipse||0.10.0||
||Soi-toolkit plugin for Eclipse||0.1.7||

*Note:* Older version such as Java SE 5 and Eclipse 3.4, 3.5 should work without any problem (even though we don't test against these versions), but we strongly recommend using Maven 2.2.1 or newer since some older versions of Maven are known to produce incorrect GPG signatures and checksums .

===Java SE===
Install Java SE according to the following instructions:

 * Download JDK for Java SE from http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/widget/jdk6.jsp
 A file named {{{jdk-6u21-windows-i586.exe}}} is downloaded to your PC.

 * Execute the downloaded installation program and use default values for the installation of both the JDK and the JRE.

 * Create an environment variable, JAVA_HOME, in Windows that points to the installation directory. 
 E.g. {{{JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_21}}}

 * Add the bin-folder of the JDK to the Windows PATH-environment variable.
 E.g. {{{PATH=...;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_21\bin}}}

 * Verify the installation in a command window with the commands {{{java –version}}},  {{{javac –version}}} och {{{set JAVA_HOME}}}. The result should be similar to:

===Eclipse===

Install Eclipse according to the following instructions:

 * Download  {{{Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers}}} from http://eclipse.org/downloads/.
 A file named {{{eclipse-jee-helios-SR1-win32.zip}}} is downloaded to your computer.

 Download the file named {{{apache-maven-2.2.1-bin.zip}}} to your computer.

 * Unzip the zip file to the desired installation folder, eg {{{C:\opt}}}.

 * Create an environment variable, {{{M2_HOME}}}, in Windows pointing out the installation.
 For example: {{{M2_HOME=C:\opt\apache-maven-2.2.1}}}

 * Add Maven's bin folder to the Windows {{{PATH}}} variable.
 For example: {{{PATH=...;C:\opt\apache-maven-2.2.1\bin}}}

 The Update Site is: http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/sites/m2e.
 
 For full installation instructions see http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/installing-m2eclipse.html.

 Notes:
  * If the installation asks for approval of certificates, so be sure to select the available certificate before the next step in the installation.
  * Restart the workspace when so requested.

 * To avoid the error message {{{"The Maven Integration requires that Eclipse be running in a JDK, because a number of Maven core plugins are using jars from the JDK. (...)"}}} follow the instructions on the following page [http://tech.karolzielinski.com/m2eclipse-eclipse-is-running-in-a-jre-but-a-jdk-is-required Eclipse is running in a JRE, but a JDK is required]

==Optional installation==

===Installing Apache ActiveMQ===
If you want to be able to perform manuel tests on your PC where JMS is involved it could be a good idea to run these tests with a external JMS provider, i.e. not a JMS provider that is embedded in Mule (as it is when you run unit tests).

Follow these instructions to install ActiveMQ locally on your PC:

 * Download ActiveMQ from http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi?path=%2Factivemq%2Fapache-activemq%2F5.3.2%2Fapache-activemq-5.3.2-bin.zip

 * Unzip to some folder, e.g. {{{C:\opt}}}

 * Go to the folder {{{C:\opt\apache-activemq-5.3.2\bin\win32}}} and execute the file {{{InstallService.bat}}}.

 Active MQ is now registered as a windows service and can be started automatically when the PC is started.
 Verify that ActiveMQ is running after the installation and start its windows service if not by:

 Open the url http://localhost:8161/admin/index.jsp in a web browser.

 A page like the following should now be displayed:
